      "message": "Hi @spinler@us.ibm.com,\n\nI\u0027ve added a Tested section to the commit message and included relevant journalctl log excerpts to demonstrate that polling mode and host selector position updates are working as intended.\n\n- The service starts successfully and enters polling mode as expected (Started polling mode: 2000ms).\n- The HostSelector position is updated periodically, confirming that the polling and position update logic are functioning.\n- Below are relevant excerpts from the journalctl logs:\n  Jul 31 00:06:47 bmc buttons[629]: Started polling mode: 2000ms\n  Jul 31 00:06:49 bmc buttons[629]: Host selector position updated to 0\n  ...\n  Jul 31 00:13:50 bmc buttons[629]: Host selector position updated to 1\n  Jul 31 00:13:52 bmc buttons[629]: Host selector position updated to 2\n\nThese results confirm that polling mode correctly samples the GPIO selector inputs and updates the D-Bus Position property as intended when pressing the UART button on the debug card.\n\nAdditionally, the code is designed to update the D-Bus Position property and log a message only when the host selector position actually changes. This ensures that only valid and changed positions are propagated to D-Bus and logged, avoiding redundant updates and unnecessary log noise.",
